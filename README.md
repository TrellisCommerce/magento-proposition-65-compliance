# Trellis Compliance Extension
The purpose of this module is to provide two CMS blocks that can be used throughout the site to show Proposition 65 
warnings to the user.

## Installation

## Configuration
This module creates two CMS blocks available for usage throughout the site.

* Warning #2 - more specific warning message about Proposition 65.

## Notes

* Image may need reworked/restyled. Can we use font-icon instead?
